# MRLR-DenseNet: Fusing Dynamic Multi‑Scale Routing and Lightweight Residual Refinement for Skin Lesion Classification

This repository provides the official PyTorch implementation of **MRLR-DenseNet**, an improved DenseNet architecture for dermoscopic skin lesion classification, as proposed in the paper:

> *School of Information Science and Engineering, Hunan University of Chinese Medicine*  
> *AI TCM Lab Hunan, Changsha, China*

The model introduces three key improvements over standard DenseNet:
1. **Improved DenseLayer** – Replaces the single 3×3 convolution with a dual‑branch (3×3 and 5×5) structure for enhanced local multi‑scale feature extraction.
2. **Lightweight Residual Refinement (LRF)** – Inserted after the first three DenseBlocks, these modules refine intermediate features with depthwise separable convolutions and a residual connection, preserving edge/texture details with minimal parameters.
3. **Dynamic Multi‑scale Routing (DMR)** – Placed at the end of the backbone, this module generates hierarchical multi‑scale responses (using 5×5, 7×7 dilated, and 9×9 dilated depthwise convolutions) and fuses them via spatially adaptive routing weights.

The model is evaluated on the **ISIC 2019** dataset (8 classes, 25,331 images, imbalanced) and achieves **85.58% accuracy**, **85.66% precision**, **85.85% recall**, and **85.67% F1‑score**, outperforming DenseNet121 by +3.69% accuracy and +4.11% F1‑score.


##  Model Architecture Overview

- **Backbone**: DenseNet121
- **Initial Layer**: Two consecutive 3×3 convolutions (instead of the original 7×7 conv)
- **DenseBlock**: Each DenseLayer uses a 3×3 + 5×5 dual‑branch (outputs added element‑wise)
- **LRF Modules**: Inserted after the first three DenseBlocks (before each transition layer)
- **DMR Module**: Applied after the final DenseBlock and batch normalization – performs hierarchical multi‑scale routing and spatial recalibration
- **Classifier**: Global average pooling + fully connected layer
